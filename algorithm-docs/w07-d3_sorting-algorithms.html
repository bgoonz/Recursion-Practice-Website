    <h1 id="bubble-sort">Bubble Sort</h1>
    <p>Bubble Sort is generally the first major sorting algorithm to come up in most introductory programming courses.
        Learning about this algorithm is useful educationally, as it provides a good introduction to the challenges you
        face when tasked with converting unsorted data into sorted data, such as conducting logical comparisons, making
        swaps while iterating, and making optimizations. It’s also quite simple to implement, and can be done quickly.
    </p>
    <p>Bubble Sort is <em>almost never</em> a good choice in production. simply because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is not efficient</li>
        <li>It is not commonly used</li>
        <li>There is a stigma attached to using it</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="butthenwhy-are-we"><em>“But…then…why are we…”</em></h2>
    <p>It is <em>quite useful</em> as an educational base for you, and as a conversational base for you while
        interviewing, because you can discuss how other more elegant and efficient algorithms improve upon it. Taking
        naive code and improving upon it by weighing the technical tradeoffs of your other options is 100% the name of
        the game when trying to level yourself up from a junior engineer to a senior engineer.</p>
    <h2 id="the-algorithm-bubbles-up">The algorithm bubbles up</h2>
    <p>As you progress through the algorithms and data structures of this course, you’ll eventually notice that there
        are some recurring funny terms. “Bubbling up” is one of those terms.</p>
    <p>When someone writes that an item in a collection “bubbles up,” you should infer that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The item is <em>in motion</em></li>
        <li>The item is moving <em>in some direction</em></li>
        <li>The item <em>has some final resting destination</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When invoking Bubble Sort to sort an array of integers in ascending order, the largest integers will “bubble up”
        to the “top” (the end) of the array, one at a time.</p>
    <p>The largest values are captured, put into motion in the direction defined by the desired sort (ascending right
        now), and traverse the array until they arrive at their end destination. See if you can observe this behavior in
        the following animation (courtesy http://visualgo.net):</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/BubbleSort.gif" alt="bubble sort" />
        <figcaption>bubble sort</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>As the algorithm iterates through the array, it compares each element to the element’s right neighbor. If the
        current element is larger than its neighbor, the algorithm swaps them. This continues until all elements in the
        array are sorted.</p>
    <h2 id="how-does-a-pass-of-bubble-sort-work">How does a pass of Bubble Sort work?</h2>
    <p>Bubble sort works by performing multiple <em>passes</em> to move elements closer to their final positions. A
        single pass will iterate through the entire array once.</p>
    <p>A pass works by scanning the array from left to right, two elements at a time, and checking if they are ordered
        correctly. To be ordered correctly the first element must be less than or equal to the second. If the two
        elements are not ordered properly, then we swap them to correct their order. Afterwards, it scans the next two
        numbers and continue repeat this process until we have gone through the entire array.</p>
    <p>See one pass of bubble sort on the array <code>[2, 8, 5, 2, 6]</code>. On each step the elements currently being
        scanned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[<strong>2</strong>, <strong>8</strong>, 5, 2, 6] - ordered, so leave them alone</li>
        <li>[2, <strong>8</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, 2, 6] - not ordered, so swap</li>
        <li>[2, 5, <strong>8</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, 6] - not ordered, so swap</li>
        <li>[2, 5, 2, <strong>8</strong>, <strong>6</strong>] - not ordered, so swap</li>
        <li>[2, 5, 2, 6, 8] - the first pass is complete</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because at least one swap occurred, the algorithm knows that it wasn’t sorted. It needs to make another pass. It
        starts over again at the first entry and goes to the next-to-last entry doing the comparisons, again. It only
        needs to go to the next-to-last entry because the previous “bubbling” put the largest entry in the last
        position.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[<strong>2</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, 2, 6, 8] - ordered, so leave them alone</li>
        <li>[2, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, 6, 8] - not ordered, so swap</li>
        <li>[2, 2, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>6</strong>, 8] - ordered, so leave them alone</li>
        <li>[2, 2, 5, 6, 8] - the second pass is complete</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because at least one swap occurred, the algorithm knows that it wasn’t sorted. Now, it can bubble from the first
        position to the last-2 position because the last two values are sorted.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[<strong>2</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, 5, 6, 8] - ordered, so leave them alone</li>
        <li>[2, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, 6, 8] - ordered, so leave them alone</li>
        <li>[2, 2, 5, 6, 8] - the third pass is complete</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No swap occurred, so the Bubble Sort stops.</p>
    <h2 id="ending-the-bubble-sort">Ending the Bubble Sort</h2>
    <p>During Bubble Sort, you can tell if the array is in sorted order by checking if a swap was made during the
        previous pass performed. If a swap was not performed during the previous pass, then the array must be totally
        sorted and the algorithm can stop.</p>
    <p>You’re probably wondering why that makes sense. Recall that a pass of Bubble Sort checks if any adjacent elements
        are <strong>out of order</strong> and swaps them if they are. If we don’t make any swaps during a pass, then
        everything must be already <strong>in order</strong>, so our job is done. Let that marinate for a bit.</p>
    <h2 id="pseudocode-for-bubble-sort">Pseudocode for Bubble Sort</h2>
    <pre><code>Bubble Sort: (array)
  n := length(array)
  repeat
  swapped = false
  for i := 1 to n - 1 inclusive do

      /* if this pair is out of order */
      if array[i - 1] &gt; array[i] then

        /* swap them and remember something changed */
        swap(array, i - 1, i)
        swapped := true

      end if
    end for
  until not swapped</code></pre>

    <h1 id="selection-sort">Selection Sort</h1>
    <p>Selection Sort is very similar to Bubble Sort. The major difference between the two is that Bubble Sort bubbles
        the <em>largest</em> elements up to the end of the array, while Selection Sort selects the <em>smallest</em>
        elements of the array and directly places them at the beginning of the array in sorted position. Selection sort
        will utilize swapping just as bubble sort did. Let’s carefully break this sorting algorithm down.</p>
    <h2 id="the-algorithm-select-the-next-smallest">The algorithm: select the next smallest</h2>
    <p>Selection sort works by maintaining a sorted region on the left side of the input array; this sorted region will
        grow by one element with every “pass” of the algorithm. A single “pass” of selection sort will select the next
        smallest element of unsorted region of the array and move it to the sorted region. Because a single pass of
        selection sort will move an element of the unsorted region into the sorted region, this means a single pass will
        shrink the unsorted region by 1 element whilst increasing the sorted region by 1 element. Selection sort is
        complete when the sorted region spans the entire array and the unsorted region is empty!</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/SelectionSort.gif" alt="selection sort" />
        <figcaption>selection sort</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The algorithm can be summarized as the following:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Set MIN to location 0</li>
        <li>Search the minimum element in the list</li>
        <li>Swap with value at location MIN</li>
        <li>Increment MIN to point to next element</li>
        <li>Repeat until list is sorted</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="the-pseudocode">The pseudocode</h2>
    <p>In pseudocode, the Selection Sort can be written as this.</p>
    <pre><code>procedure selection sort
   list  : array of items
   n     : size of list

   for i = 1 to n - 1
   /* set current element as minimum*/
      min = i

      /* check the element to be minimum */

      for j = i+1 to n
         if list[j] &lt; list[min] then
            min = j;
         end if
      end for

      /* swap the minimum element with the current element*/
      if indexMin != i  then
         swap list[min] and list[i]
      end if
   end for
end procedure</code></pre>
    <hr />
    <h1 id="insertion-sort">Insertion Sort</h1>
    <p>With Bubble Sort and Selection Sort now in your tool box, you’re starting to get some experience points under
        your belt! Time to learn one more “naive” sorting algorithm before you get to the efficient sorting algorithms.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-algorithm-insert-into-the-sorted-region">The algorithm: insert into the sorted region</h2>
    <p>Insertion Sort is similar to Selection Sort in that it gradually builds up a larger and larger sorted region at
        the left-most end of the array.</p>
    <p>However, Insertion Sort differs from Selection Sort because this algorithm does not focus on searching for the
        right element to place (the next smallest in our Selection Sort) on each pass through the array. Instead, it
        focuses on sorting each element in the order they appear from left to right, regardless of their value, and
        inserting them in the most appropriate position in the sorted region.</p>
    <p>See if you can observe the behavior described above in the following animation:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/InsertionSort.gif" alt="insertion sort" />
        <figcaption>insertion sort</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="the-steps">The Steps</h2>
    <p>Insertion Sort grows a sorted array on the left side of the input array by:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;</li>
        <li>Pick next element</li>
        <li>Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list</li>
        <li>Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the value to be sorted</li>
        <li>Insert the value</li>
        <li>Repeat until list is sorted</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These steps are easy to confuse with selection sort, so you’ll want to watch the video lecture and drawing that
        accompanies this reading as always!</p>
    <h2 id="the-pseudocode-1">The pseudocode</h2>
    <pre><code>procedure insertionSort( A : array of items )
   int holePosition
   int valueToInsert

   for i = 1 to length(A) inclusive do:

      /* select value to be inserted */
      valueToInsert = A[i]
      holePosition = i

      /*locate hole position for the element to be inserted */

      while holePosition &gt; 0 and A[holePosition-1] &gt; valueToInsert do:
         A[holePosition] = A[holePosition-1]
         holePosition = holePosition -1
      end while

      /* insert the number at hole position */
      A[holePosition] = valueToInsert

   end for

end procedure</code></pre>

    <h1 id="merge-sort">Merge Sort</h1>
    <p>You’ve explored a few sorting algorithms already, all of them being quite slow with a runtime of
        O(n<sup>2</sup>). It’s time to level up and learn your first time-efficient sorting algorithm! You’ll explore
        <strong>merge sort</strong> in detail soon, but first, you should jot down some key ideas for now. The following
        points are not steps to an algorithm yet; rather, they are ideas that will motivate how you can derive this
        algorithm.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it is easy to merge elements of two sorted arrays into a single sorted array</li>
        <li>you can consider an array containing only a single element as already trivially sorted</li>
        <li>you can also consider an empty array as trivially sorted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-algorithm-divide-and-conquer">The algorithm: divide and conquer</h2>
    <p>You’re going to need a helper function that solves the first major point from above. How might you merge two
        sorted arrays? In other words you want a <code>merge</code> function that will behave like so:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4">
        <pre
            class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> arr1 <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">10</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">15</span>]<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" title="2"><span class="kw">let</span> arr2 <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">7</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">10</span>]<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3"><span class="at">merge</span>(arr1<span class="op">,</span> arr2)<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 10, 15]</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Once you have that, you get to the “divide and conquer” bit.</p>
    <p>The algorithm for merge sort is actually <em>really</em> simple.</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>if there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted. return that array.</li>
        <li>otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.</li>
        <li>merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The process is visualized below. When elements are moved to the bottom of the picture, they are going through the
        <code>merge</code> step:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/MergeSort.gif" alt="merge sort" />
        <figcaption>merge sort</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The pseudocode for the algorithm is as follows.</p>
    <pre><code>procedure mergesort( a as array )
   if ( n == 1 ) return a

   /* Split the array into two */
   var l1 as array = a[0] ... a[n/2]
   var l2 as array = a[n/2+1] ... a[n]

   l1 = mergesort( l1 )
   l2 = mergesort( l2 )

   return merge( l1, l2 )
end procedure

procedure merge( a as array, b as array )
   var result as array
   while ( a and b have elements )
      if ( a[0] &gt; b[0] )
         add b[0] to the end of result
         remove b[0] from b
      else
         add a[0] to the end of result
         remove a[0] from a
      end if
   end while

   while ( a has elements )
      add a[0] to the end of result
      remove a[0] from a
   end while

   while ( b has elements )
      add b[0] to the end of result
      remove b[0] from b
   end while

   return result
end procedure</code></pre>

    <h1 id="quick-sort">Quick Sort</h1>
    <p>Quick Sort has a similar “divide and conquer” strategy to Merge Sort. Here are a few key ideas that will motivate
        the design:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value</li>
        <li>an array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding that first point, for example given <code>[7, 3, 8, 9, 2]</code> and a target of <code>5</code>, we
        know <code>[3, 2]</code> are numbers less than <code>5</code> and <code>[7, 8, 9]</code> are numbers greater
        than <code>5</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
    <p>In general, the strategy is to divide the input array into two subarrays: one with the smaller elements, and one
        with the larger elements. Then, it recursively operates on the two new subarrays. It continues this process
        until of dividing into smaller arrays until it reaches subarrays of length 1 or smaller. As you have seen with
        Merge Sort, arrays of such length are automatically sorted.</p>
    <p>The steps, when discussed on a high level, are simple:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>choose an element called “the pivot”, how that’s done is up to the implementation</li>
        <li>take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot</li>
        <li>left points to the low index</li>
        <li>right points to the high</li>
        <li>while value at left is less than pivot move right</li>
        <li>while value at right is greater than pivot move left</li>
        <li>if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right</li>
        <li>if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot</li>
        <li>repeat, recursively calling this for smaller and smaller arrays</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Before we move forward, see if you can observe the behavior described above in the following animation:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/QuickSort.gif" alt="quick sort" />
        <figcaption>quick sort</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="the-algorithm-divide-and-conquer-1">The algorithm: divide and conquer</h2>
    <p>Formally, we want to partition elements of an array relative to a pivot value. That is, we want elements less
        than the pivot to be separated from elements that are greater than or equal to the pivot. Our goal is to create
        a function with this behavior:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb6">
        <pre
            class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> arr <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">7</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">8</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">9</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">2</span>]<span class="op">;</span></a>

        divide and conquer.</p>

    <h1 id="binary-search">Binary Search</h1>
    <p>We’ve explored many ways to sort arrays so far, but why did we go through all of that trouble? By sorting
        elements of an array, we are organizing the data in a way that gives us a quick way to look up elements later
        on. For simplicity, we have been using arrays of numbers up until this point. However, these sorting concepts
        can be generalized to other data types. For example, it would be easy to modify our comparison-based sorting
        algorithms to sort strings: instead of leveraging facts like <code>0 &lt; 1</code>, we can say <code>'A' &lt;
            'B'</code>.</p>
    <p>Think of a dictionary. A dictionary contains alphabetically sorted words and their definitions. A dictionary is
        pretty much only useful if it is ordered in this way. Let’s say you wanted to look up the definition of
        “stupendous.” What steps might you take?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you open up the dictionary at the roughly middle page
            <ul>
                <li>you land in the “m” section</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>you know “s” comes somewhere after “m” in the book, so you disregard all pages before the “m” section.
            Instead, you flip to the roughly middle page between “m” and “z”
            <ul>
                <li>you land in the “u” section</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>you know “s” comes somewhere before “u”, so you can disregard all pages after the “u” section. Instead, you
            flip to the roughly middle page between the previous “m” page and “u”</li>
        <li>…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are essentially using the <code>binarySearch</code> algorithm in the real world.</p>

    <h2 id="time-complexity-on2">Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)</h2>
    <p>Picture the worst case scenario where the input array is completely unsorted. Say it’s sorted in fully decreasing
        order, but the goal is to sort it in increasing order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>n is the length of the input array</li>
        <li>The inner <code>for</code> loop along contributes <em>O(n)</em> in isolation</li>
        <li>The outer while loop contributes <em>O(n)</em> in isolation because a single iteration of the while loop
            will bring one element to its final resting position. In other words, it keeps running the while loop until
            the array is fully sorted. To fully sort the array we will need to bring all <code>n</code> elements into
            their final resting positions.</li>
        <li>Those two loops are nested so the total time complexity is O(n * n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s worth mentioning that the best case scenario is when the input array is already fully sorted. This will
        cause our for loop to conduct a single pass without performing any swap, so the <code>while</code> loop will not
        trigger further iterations. This means best case time complexity is <em>O(n)</em> for bubble sort. This best
        case linear time is probably the only advantage of bubble sort. Programmers are usually interested only in the
        worst-case analysis and ignore best-case analysis.</p>
    <h2 id="space-complexity-o1">Space Complexity: O(1)</h2>
    <p>Bubble Sort is a constant space, O(1), algorithm. The amount of memory consumed by the algorithm does not
        increase relative to the size of the input array. It uses the same amount of memory and create the same amount
        of variables regardless of the size of the input, making this algorithm quite space efficient. The space
        efficiency mostly comes from the fact that it mutates the input array in-place. This is known as a
        <strong>destructive sort</strong> because it “destroys” the positions of the values in the array.</p>
    <h2 id="when-should-you-use-bubble-sort">When should you use Bubble Sort?</h2>
    <p>Nearly never, but it may be a good choice in the following list of special cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When sorting really small arrays where run time will be negligible no matter what algorithm you choose.</li>
        <li>When sorting arrays that you expect to already be nearly sorted.</li>

    <p>Selection Sort runtime is O(n<sup>2</sup>) because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>n</code> is the length of the input array</li>
        <li>The outer loop i contributes O(n) in isolation, this is plain to see</li>
        <li>The inner loop j is more complicated, it will make one less iteration for every iteration of i.
            <ul>
                <li>for example, let’s say we have an array of 10 elements, <code>n = 10</code>.</li>
                <li>the first full cycle of <code>j</code> will have 9 iterations</li>
                <li>the second full cycle of <code>j</code> will have 8 iterations</li>
                <li>the third full cycle of <code>j</code> will have 7 iterations</li>
                <li>…</li>
                <li>the last full cycle of <code>j</code> will have 1 iteration</li>
                <li>This means that the inner loop j will contribute roughly O(n / 2) on average</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The two loops are nested so our total time complexity is O(n * n / 2) = O(n<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You’ll notice that during this analysis we said something silly like O(n / 2). In some analyses such as this one,
        we’ll prefer to drop the constants only at the end of the sketch so you understand the logical steps we took to
        derive a complicated time complexity.</p>
    <h2 id="space-complexity-analysis-o1">Space Complexity Analysis: O(1)</h2>
    <p>The amount of memory consumed by the algorithm does not increase relative to the size of the input array. We use
        the same amount of memory and create the same amount of variables regardless of the size of our input. A quick
        indicator of this is the fact that we don’t create any arrays.</p>
    <h2 id="when-should-we-use-selection-sort">When should we use Selection Sort?</h2>
    <p>There is really only one use case where Selection Sort becomes superior to Bubble Sort. Both algorithms are
        quadratic in time and constant in space, but the point at which they differ is in the <em>number of swaps</em>
        they make.</p>
    <p>Bubble Sort, in the worst case, invokes a swap on every single comparison. Selection Sort only swaps once our
        inner loop has completely finished traversing the array. Therefore, Selection Sort is optimized to make the
        least possible number of swaps.</p>
    <p>Selection Sort becomes advantageous when making a swap is the most expensive operation in your system. You will
        likely rarely encounter this scenario, but in a situation where you’ve built (or have inherited) a system with
        suboptimal write speed ability, for instance, maybe you’re sorting data in a specialized database tuned strictly
        for fast read speeds at the expense of slow write speeds, using Selection Sort would save you a ton of expensive
        operations that could potential crash your system under peak load.</p>
    <p>Though in industry this situation is very rare, the insights above make for a fantastic conversational piece when
        weighing technical tradeoffs while strategizing solutions in an interview setting. This commentary may help
        deliver the impression that you are well-versed in system design and technical analysis, a key indicator that
        someone is prepared for a senior level position.</p>

    <p>There are a few key pieces to point out in the above solution before moving forward:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <p>The outer <code>for</code> loop starts at the 1st index, not the 0th index, and moves to the right.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The inner <code>for</code> loop starts immediately to the left of the current element, and moves to the
                left.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The condition for the inner <code>for</code> loop is complicated, and behaves similarly to a while loop!
            <ul>
                <li>It continues iterating to the left toward <code>j = 0</code>, <em>only while</em> the
                    <code>currElement</code> is less than <code>arr[j]</code>.</li>
                <li>It does this over and over until it finds the proper place to insert <code>currElement</code>, and
                    then we exit the inner loop!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When shifting elements in the sorted region to the right, it <em>does not</em> replace the value at their
                old index! If the input array is <code>[1, 2, 4, 3]</code>, and <code>currElement</code> is
                <code>3</code>, after comparing <code>4</code> and <code>3</code>, but before inserting <code>3</code>
                between <code>2</code> and <code>4</code>, the array will look like this: <code>[1, 2, 4, 4]</code>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are currently scratching your head, that is perfectly okay because when this one clicks, it clicks for
        good.</p>
    <p>If you’re struggling, you should try taking out a pen and paper and step through the solution provided above one
        step at a time. Keep track of <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>currElement</code>, <code>arr[j]</code>, and
        the input <code>arr</code> itself <em>at every step</em>. After going through this a few times, you’ll have your
        “ah HA!” moment.</p>
    <h2 id="time-and-space-complexity-analysis">Time and Space Complexity Analysis</h2>
    <p>Insertion Sort runtime is O(n<sup>2</sup>) because:</p>
    <p>In the <strong>worst case scenario</strong> where our input array is entirely unsorted, since this algorithm
        contains a nested loop, its run time behaves similarly to <code>bubbleSort</code> and
        <code>selectionSort</code>. In this case, we are forced to make a comparison at each iteration of the inner
        loop. Not convinced? Let’s derive the complexity. We’ll use much of the same argument as we did in
        <code>selectionSort</code>. Say we had the worst case scenario where are input array is sorted in full
        decreasing order, but we wanted to sort it in increasing order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>n</code> is the length of the input array</li>
        <li>The outer loop i contributes O(n) in isolation, this is plain to see</li>
        <li>The inner loop j is more complicated. We know j will iterate until it finds an appropriate place to insert
            the <code>currElement</code> into the sorted region. However, since we are discussing the case where the
            data is already in decreasing order, the element must travel the maximum distance to find it’s insertion
            point! We know this insertion point to be index 0, since every <code>currElement</code> will be the next
            smallest of the array. So:
            <ul>
                <li>the 1st element travels 1 distance to be inserted</li>
                <li>the 2nd element travels 2 distance to be inserted</li>
                <li>the 3rd element travels 3 distance to be inserted</li>
                <li>…</li>
                <li>the n-1th element travels n-1 distance to be inserted</li>
                <li>This means that our inner loop j will contribute roughly O(n / 2) on average</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The two loops are nested so our total time complexity is O(n * n / 2) = O(n<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The amount of memory consumed by the algorithm does not increase relative to the size of the input array. We use
        the same amount of memory and create the same amount of variables regardless of the size of our input. A quick
        indicator of this is the fact that we don’t create any arrays.</p>
    <h2 id="when-should-you-use-insertion-sort">When should you use Insertion Sort?</h2>
    <p>Insertion Sort has one advantage that makes it absolutely supreme in one special case. Insertion Sort is what’s
        known as an “online” algorithm. Online algorithms are great when you’re dealing with <em>streaming data</em>,
        because they can sort the data live <em>as it is received</em>.</p>
    <p>If you must sort a set of data that is ever-incoming, for example, maybe you are sorting the most relevant posts
        in a social media feed so that those posts that are most likely to impact the site’s audience always appear at
        the top of the feed, an online algorithm like Insertion Sort is a great option.</p>
    <p>Insertion Sort works well in this situation because the left side of the array is always sorted, and in the case
        of nearly sorted arrays, it can run in linear time. The absolute best case scenario for Insertion Sort is when
        there is only one unsorted element, and it is located all the way to the right of the array.</p>
    <p>Well, if you have data constantly being pushed to the array, it will always be added to the right side. If you
        keep your algorithm constantly running, the left side will always be sorted. Now you have linear time sort.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, Insertion Sort is, in general, useful in all the same situations as Bubble Sort. It’s a good option
        when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are sorting really small arrays where run time will be negligible no matter what algorithm we choose.
        </li>
        <li>You are sorting an array that you expect to already be nearly sorted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Merging two sorted arrays is simple. Since both arrays are sorted, we know the smallest numbers to always be at
        the front of the arrays. We can construct the new array by comparing the first elements of both input arrays. We
        remove the smaller element from it’s respective array and add it to our new array. Do this until both input
        arrays are empty:</p>

    <p>By using <code>Infinity</code> as the default element when an array is empty, we are able to elegantly handle the
        scenario where one array empties before the other. We know that any actual element will be less than
        <code>Infinity</code> so we will continually take the other element into our merged array.</p>
    <p>In other words, we can safely handle this edge case:</p>

    <p>Nice! We now have a way to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. It’s worth mentioning that
        <code>merge</code> will have a <code>O(n)</code> runtime where <code>n</code> is the combined length of the two
        input arrays. This is what we meant when we said it was “easy” to merge two sorted arrays; linear time is fast!
        We’ll find fact this useful later.</p>
    <h2 id="divide-and-conquer-step-by-step">Divide and conquer, step-by-step</h2>
    <p>Now that we satisfied the merge idea, let’s handle the second point. That is, we say an array of 1 or 0 elements
        is already sorted. This will be the base case of our recursion. Let’s begin adding this code:</p>

    <p>If our base case pertains to an array of a very small size, then the design of our recursive case should make
        progress toward hitting this base scenario. In other words, we should recursively call <code>mergeSort</code> on
        smaller and smaller arrays. A logical way to do this is to take the input array and split it into left and right
        halves.</p>

    <p>Here is the part of the recursion where we do a lot of hand waving and we take things on faith. We know that

    <p>Wow. that’s it. Notice how light the implementation of <code>mergeSort</code> is. Much of the heavy lifting (the
        actually comparisons) is done by the <code>merge</code> helper.</p>
    <p><code>mergeSort</code> is a classic example of a “Divide and Conquer” algorithm. In other words, we keep breaking
        the array into smaller and smaller sub arrays. This is the same as saying we take the problem and break it down
        into smaller and smaller subproblems. We do this until the subproblems are so small that we trivially know the
        answer to them (an array length 0 or 1 is already sorted). Once we have those subanswers we can combine to
        reconstruct the larger problems that we previously divided (merge the left and right subarrays).</p>

                    split 5 times before reaching the base case, <code>log(32) = 5</code></li>
                <li>in our algorithm, <strong>log(n)</strong> describes how many times we must halve <strong>n</strong>
                    until the quantity reaches 1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Besides the recursive calls, we must consider the while loop within the <code>merge</code> function, which
            contributes <code>O(n)</code> in isolation</li>
        <li>We call <code>merge</code> in every recursive <code>mergeSort</code> call, so the total complexity is
            <strong>O(n * log(n))</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="space-complexity-on">Space Complexity: O(n)</h3>
    <p>Merge Sort is the first non-O(1) space sorting algorithm we’ve seen thus far.</p>
    <p>The larger the size of our input array, the greater the number of subarrays we must create in memory. These are
        not free! They each take up finite space, and we will need a new subarray for each element in the original
        input. Therefore, Merge Sort has a linear space complexity, O(n).</p>
    <h3 id="when-should-you-use-merge-sort">When should you use Merge Sort?</h3>
    <p>Unless we, the engineers, have access in advance to some unique, exploitable insight about our dataset, it turns
        out that O(n log n) time is <em>the best</em> we can do when sorting unknown datasets.</p>
    <p>That means that Merge Sort is fast! It’s way faster than Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
        However, due to its linear space complexity, we must always weigh the trade off between speed and memory
        consumption when making the choice to use Merge Sort. Consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have unlimited memory available, use it, it’s fast!</li>
        <li>If you have a decent amount of memory available and a medium sized dataset, run some tests first, but use
            it!</li>
        <li>In other cases, maybe you should consider other options.</li>

    <h1 id="quick-sort-1">Quick Sort</h1>
    <p>Let’s begin structuring the recursion. The base case of any recursive problem is where the input is so trivial,
        we immediately know the answer without calculation. If our problem is to sort an array, what is the trivial
        array? An array of 1 or 0 elements! Let’s establish the code:</p>

    <p>If our base case pertains to an array of a very small size, then the design of our recursive case should make
        progress toward hitting this base scenario. In other words, we should recursively call <code>quickSort</code> on
        smaller and smaller arrays. This is very similar to our previous <code>mergeSort</code>, except we don’t just
        split the array down the middle. Instead we should arbitrarily choose an element of the array as a pivot and
        partition the remaining elements relative to this pivot:</p>

    <p>Okay, so we have the two sorted partitions. This means we have the two subsolutions. But how do we put them
        together? Think about how we partitioned them in the first place. Everything in <code>leftSorted</code> is
        <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be less than everything in <code>rightSorted</code>. On top of that,
        <code>pivot</code> should be placed after the last element in <code>leftSorted</code>, but before the first
        element in <code>rightSorted</code>. So all we need to do is to combine the elements in the order “left, pivot,

    <h2 id="time-and-space-complexity-analysis-2">Time and Space Complexity Analysis</h2>
    <p>Here is a summary of the complexity.</p>
    <h3 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Avg Case: O(n log(n))</li>
        <li>Worst Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The runtime analysis of <code>quickSort</code> is more complex than <code>mergeSort</code></p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>n</code> is the length of the input array</li>
        <li>The partition step alone is <code>O(n)</code></li>
        <li>We must calculate how many recursive calls we make. The number of recursive calls is the number of times we
            must split the array to reach the base case. This is dependent on how we choose the pivot. Let’s analyze the
            best and worst case:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> We are lucky and always choose the median as the pivot. This means the
                    left and right partitions will have equal length. This will halve the array length at every step of
                    the recursion. We benefit from this halving with <code>O(log(n))</code> recursive calls to reach the
                    base case.</li>
                <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> We are unlucky and always choose the min or max as the pivot. This
                    means one partition will contain everything, and the other partition is empty. This will decrease
                    the array length by 1 at every step of the recursion. We suffer from <code>O(n)</code> recursive
                    calls to reach the base case.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The partition step occurs in every recursive call, so our total complexities are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> O(n * log(n))</li>
                <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n<sup>2</sup>)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although we typically take the worst case when describing Big-O for an algorithm, much research on
        <code>quickSort</code> has shown the worst case to be an exceedingly rare occurrence even if we choose the pivot
        at random. Because of this we still consider <code>quickSort</code> an efficient algorithm. This is a common
        interview talking point, so you should be familiar with the relationship between the choice of pivot and
        efficiency of the algorithm.</p>
    <p>Just in case: A somewhat common question a student may ask when studying <code>quickSort</code> is, “If the
        median is the best pivot, why don’t we always just choose the median when we partition?” Don’t overthink this.
        To know the median of an array, it must be sorted in the first place.</p>
    <h3 id="space-complexity">Space Complexity</h3>
    <p>Our implementation of <code>quickSort</code> uses <code>O(n)</code> space because of the partition arrays we
        create. There is an in-place version of <code>quickSort</code> that uses <code>O(log(n))</code> space.
        <code>O(log(n))</code> space is not huge benefit over <code>O(n)</code>. You’ll also find our version of
        <code>quickSort</code> as easier to remember, easier to implement. Just know that a <code>O(logn)</code> space
        <code>quickSort</code> exists.</p>
    <h3 id="when-should-you-use-quick-sort">When should you use Quick Sort?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you are in a pinch and need to throw down an efficient sort (on average). The recursive code is light
            and simple to implement; much smaller than <code>mergeSort</code>.</li>
        <li>When constant space is important to you, use the in-place version. This will of course trade off some
            simplicity of implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you know some constraints about dataset you can make some modifications to optimize pivot choice. Here’s some
        food for thought. Our implementation of <code>quickSort</code> will always take the first element as the pivot.
        This means we will suffer from the worst case time complexity in the event that we are given an already sorted
        array (ironic isn’t it?). If you know your input data to be mostly already sorted, randomize the choice of pivot
        - this is a very easy change. Bam. Solved like a true engineer.</p>
    <hr />
    <h1 id="binary-search-1">Binary Search</h1>
    <p>We’ll implement binary search recursively. As always, we start with a base case that captures the scenario of the
        input array being so trivial, that we know the answer without further calculation. If we are given an empty

    <p>It’s worth pointing out that the left and right halves do not contain the middle element we chose.</p>
    <p>Here is where we leverage the sorted property of the array. If the target is less than the middle, then the
        target must be in the left half of the array. If the target is greater than the middle, then the target must be
        in the right half of the array. So we can narrow our search to one of these halves, and ignore the other.
        Luckily we have a function that can search the half, its <code>binarySearch</code>:</p>

        ourselves. However, something is lacking in our code. It is only possible to get a false from the literal
        <code>return false</code> line, but there is no <code>return true</code>. Looking at our conditionals, we handle
        the cases where the target is less than middle or the target is greater than the middle, but what if the product
        is <strong>equal</strong> to the middle? If the target is equal to the middle, then we found the target and

    <h2 id="time-and-space-complexity-analysis-3">Time and Space Complexity Analysis</h2>
    <p>The complexity analysis of this algorithm is easier to explain through visuals, so we <strong>highly
            encourage</strong> you to watch the lecture that accompanies this reading. In any case, here is a summary of
        the complexity:</p>
    <h3 id="time-complexity-ologn">Time Complexity: O(log(n))</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>n</code> is the length of the input array</li>
        <li>We have no loops, so we must only consider the number of recursive calls it takes to hit the base case</li>
        <li>The number of recursive calls is the number of times we must halve the array until it’s length becomes 0.
            This number can be described by <code>log(n)</code>
            <ul>
                <li>for example, say we had an array of 8 elements, <code>n = 8</code></li>
                <li>the length would halve as <code>8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1</code></li>
                <li>it takes 3 calls, <code>log(8) = 3</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="space-complexity-on-1">Space Complexity: O(n)</h3>
    <p>Our implementation uses <code>n</code> space due to half arrays we create using slice. Note that JavaScript
        <code>slice</code> creates a new array, so it requires additional memory to be allocated.</p>
    <h3 id="when-should-we-use-binary-search">When should we use Binary Search?</h3>
    <p>Use this algorithm when the input data is sorted!!! This is a heavy requirement, but if you have it, you’ll have
        an insanely fast algorithm. Of course, you can use one of your high-functioning sorting algorithms to sort the
        input and <em>then</em> perform the binary search!</p>

    <p>This project contains a skeleton for you to implement Quick Sort. In the file <strong>lib/quick_sort.js</strong>,
        you should implement the Quick Sort. This is a description of how the Quick Sort works (and is also in the code
        file).</p>
    <pre><code>procedure quick sort (array)
  if the length of the array is 0 or 1, return the array

  set the pivot to the first element of the array
  remove the first element of the array

  put all values less than the pivot value into an array called left
  put all values greater than the pivot value into an array called right

  call quick sort on left and assign the return value to leftSorted
  call quick sort on right and assign the return value to rightSorted

  return the concatenation of leftSorted, the pivot value, and rightSorted

    <h1 id="binary-search-2">Binary Search</h1>
    <p>This project contains a skeleton for you to implement Binary Search. In the file
        <strong>lib/binary_search.js</strong>, you should implement the Binary Search and its cousin Binary Search
        Index.</p>
    <p>The Binary Search algorithm can be summarized as the following:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>If the array is empty, then return false</li>
        <li>Check the value in the middle of the array against the target value</li>
        <li>If the value is equal to the target value, then return true</li>
        <li>If the value is less than the target value, then return the binary search on the left half of the array for
            the target</li>
        <li>If the value is greater than the target value, then return the binary search on the right half of the array
            for the target</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is a description of how the Binary Search works (and is also in the code file).</p>
    <pre><code>procedure binary search (list, target)
  parameter list: a list of sorted value
  parameter target: the value to search for

  if the list has zero length, then return false

  determine the slice point:
    if the list has an even number of elements,
      the slice point is the number of elements
      divided by two
    if the list has an odd number of elements,
      the slice point is the number of elements
      minus one divided by two

  create an list of the elements from 0 to the
    slice point, not including the slice point,
    which is known as the &quot;left half&quot;
  create an list of the elements from the
    slice point to the end of the list which is
    known as the &quot;right half&quot;

  if the target is less than the value in the
    original array at the slice point, then
    return the binary search of the &quot;left half&quot;
    and the target
  if the target is greater than the value in the
    original array at the slice point, then
    return the binary search of the &quot;right half&quot;
    and the target
  if neither of those is true, return true
end procedure binary search</code></pre>
    <p>Then you need to adapt that to return <em>the index</em> of the found item rather than a Boolean value. The
        pseudocode is also in the code file.</p>
    <pre><code>procedure binary search index(list, target, low, high)
  parameter list: a list of sorted value
  parameter target: the value to search for
  parameter low: the lower index for the search
  parameter high: the upper index for the search

  if low is equal to high, then return -1 to indicate
    that the value was not found

  determine the slice point:
    if the list between the high index and the low index
    has an even number of elements,
      the slice point is the number of elements
      between high and low divided by two
    if the list between the high index and the low index
    has an odd number of elements,
      the slice point is the number of elements
      between high and low minus one, divided by two

  if the target is less than the value in the
    original array at the slice point, then
    return the binary search of the array,
    the target, low, and the slice point
  if the target is greater than the value in the
    original array at the slice point, then return
    the binary search of the array, the target,
    the slice point plus one, and high
  if neither of those is true, return the slice point
end procedure binary search index</code></pre>
